# Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance is a set of activities and processes designed to ensure that a product or service meets specific quality requirements and standards. QA is an integral part of the software development lifecycle and is focused on preventing defects and ensuring that the final product meets customer expectations.

The choice of tools depends on specific project requirements, budget, and the testing approach followed by the organization. It's essential to evaluate and select tools that best fit your team's needs and provide the necessary support for efficient and effective QA processes.

QA is typically performed by dedicated quality assurance teams or individuals who are responsible for overseeing and implementing QA processes. They work closely with developers, testers, and other stakeholders to ensure that quality is built into the software from the early stages of development.

It's important to note that QA is distinct from Quality Control (QC), which involves the actual testing and verification of the product or service. While QA focuses on prevention and process improvement, QC focuses on detection and correction of defects through testing and inspection.

Together, QA and QC activities contribute to ensuring that the final product or service meets the desired level of quality, reliability, and customer satisfaction.
