# Quality Assurance
Quality Assurance is a set of activities and processes designed to ensure that a product or service meets specific quality requirements and standards. QA is an integral part of the software development lifecycle and is focused on preventing defects and ensuring that the final product meets customer expectations.

The choice of tools depends on specific project requirements, budget, and the testing approach followed by the organization. It's essential to evaluate and select tools that best fit your team's needs and provide the necessary support for efficient and effective QA processes.
